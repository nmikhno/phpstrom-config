# Raised with the interrupt signal is received, typically because the
# user pressed on Control-C (on most posix platforms). As such, it is a
# subclass of +SignalException+.

#      loop {}
#    rescue Interrupt => e
#      puts "Note: You will typically use Signal.trap instead."

# 
# <em>produces:</em>
# 
#    Press ctrl-C when you get bored
# 
# <em>then waits until it is interrupted with Control-C and then prints:</em>
